# Project 1: MLB Attendance Analysis

#Team Members: Derek Shashek, Howard Mitchell, Pramit Ghosh, and Aly Smith

#Outline:
#We will be compiling data sets related to MLB baseball teams including weather conditions, metropolitan statistics, and stadium prices. We will be comparing the affects of the above data sets on the attendance for each team and discussing why the analysis of these factors are helpful for revenue projections.

#Questions: 
#Does the weather (temperature and conditions) affect the attendance per game for each team throughout 2016?
#Does the metropolitan size affect the average attendance for each stadium over a 10- year span (considering the stadium capacity)?
#Does the attendance per stadium affect the average team salary across a 10-year span?

#Datasets:

#the .gitignore file is set to ignore config.py in the top level directory.  I'm assuming this will require us to use API keys so put yours Group-Project-1/config.py
