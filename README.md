**Project 1: MLB Attendance Analysis**

**Red Team Members:** Derek Shashek, Howard Mitchell, Pramit Ghosh, and Aly Smith

**Outline:** 

We will be compiling data sets related to MLB baseball teams including weather conditions, metropolitan statistics, team win records, and team salary totals. We will be comparing the affects of the above data sets on the attendance for each team and discussing whether there are direct correlations between them.

**Questions:** 

Does the weather (temperature and conditions) affect the attendance per game for each team throughout 2016?

Does the metropolitan size affect the average attendance for each stadium over a 10- year span (considering the stadium capacity as well)?

Do the team win records per season affect the attendance across a 10-year span? Does whether or not a team making it into post season affect attendance as well?

Does the total team salary each season affect the attendence per season across a 10-year span?

the .gitignore file is set to ignore config.py in the top level directory.  I'm assuming this will require us to use API keys so put yours Group-Project-1/config.py
